# cargo-build-deps

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/romac/cargo-build-deps.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/romac/cargo-build-deps)

This tool extends [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) to allow you to
build only the dependencies in a given rust project. This is useful for docker
builds where each build step is cached. The time it takes to build dependencies
is often a significant portion of the overall build time. Therefore it is
beneficial in docker builds to build dependencies in a separate step earlier
than the main build. Since the dependency building step will be cached,
dependencies will not need to be rebuilt when the project's own source code
changes.

## Notice

- This is a fork of [@nacardin](https://github.com/nacardin)'s [repository](https://github.com/nacardin/cargo-build-deps), which appears be unmaintained at the moment.
- `cargo-build-deps` now requires a nightly version of Rust.

## Install
